In "Settings"
    1. LAYOUT is a list of lists, each inner list is a level's layout

In "Sprites" -> Layout class
    1. in __init__ image vars, tile list, group for platform sprites

    2. created "create_layout" method
        a. empty tile list
        b. create layout base on level param, minus one to convert to index of list
        c. added a value to the tuple for the exit, to use as the exit identifier

In "Main"
    1. initialize all critical game objects (pygame, layout and player)

    2. "reset_level(level)" function to load each level
        a. global vars to accept/change
        b. empty any sprite groups
        c. create new layout and player
        d. get/return new layout list

    3. "game_play()"
        a. global vars to accept/change
        b. level and max_level vars
        c. collision with tiles of length 3, which is an exit
            i.  increment the level
            ii. check if level is less than the max number of levels
                -> if True: call "reset_level(level)" AND accept returned list
                -> else: end the game loop and "game_play()"

    4. code to run the game_start(), game_play(), and game_over(score) functions,
        not keeping score so score value is hardcoded as 5
